Prototype (phase-2) created for HackerRamp'24

Online shopping lacks the advantage of trying on outfits, available while shopping in-person. This limits a large population from shopping online. Moreover, different products cannot be tried on simultaneously to see how they suit oneself. 

Our feature allows users to curate digital outfits. To make this suitable for GenZ, this feature is gamified and in the form of avatar customizations, enabling users to experiment with fashion, create different outfits from available products and see how well they suit their aesthetic and style.
